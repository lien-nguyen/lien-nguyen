# 👋 Hi, I’m Lien Nguyen!

🎓 *“An advocate for optimization and transformation of BI processes using state-of-the-art technologies and tools and an active life-long learner.”*

I'm a Senior Full-Stack Data Analyst evolving into **DevOps Engineer** — bringing Open Source tools, automation, and platform thinking into real-world data systems.  
Introduced Linux Ubuntu and modern Open Source stack alongside existing Suse systems — now powering the company’s new infrastructure. Sharing lessons from data platforms, DevOps pipelines, and building reproducible environments from scratch.

I build solutions that bridge business goals and technical implementation — from data pipelines and analytics to infrastructure automation, platform setup, and machine learning prototypes.
